# Evidence-Based VPS TCP Tuning Method

Source: Lide, “让 AI 帮你调 VPS 网络：中转机和落地机 TCP 调优笔记”, iBytebox, 2026-07-07, https://blog.ibytebox.com/posts/ai-agent-vps-tcp-tuning/. This file is a concise adaptation for agent reuse, not a verbatim copy.

## Input Contract

Collect or ask for:

| Field | Why it matters |
| --- | --- |
| `target_ssh` | Use aliases; never request private keys or secrets. |
| `machine_role` | Relay and landing nodes optimize different directions. |
| `traffic_path` | Needed to map measurements to real UX. |
| `critical_direction` | User download/upload may map to target egress/ingress differently. |
| `proxy_software` / `proxy_protocols` | TCP and UDP/QUIC respond to different knobs. |
| `service_ports` | Identify real services and testing ports. |
| `advertised_bandwidth` | Bound shaping ladder and BDP estimates. |
| `test_peers` | Peer label, IP/host, iperf3 port, ICMP, SSH, role. |
| `peer_lifecycle` | Long-term/renewing peers should drive persistent tuning; soon-to-expire hosts may be tested for observation but should not dominate decisions. |
| `permission_boundary` | Inspect, test, recommend, apply, reboot, MTU, shaping, cleanup. Persistent apply still requires explicit approval of the recommendation. |

If these are missing, ask before remote work. If the user already provided some fields, ask only for the missing/high-risk ones. If the user says `进行TCP调优`, `tcp调优`, `VPS网络调优`, or similar, treat it as invoking this skill and start with the active questioning gate.

## Read-Only Inspection

Collect enough evidence to explain current state before changing it:

```bash
hostname; uname -r; cat /etc/os-release
lscpu | sed -n '1,20p'; free -h; swapon --show
ip -br addr show; ip route get 1.1.1.1; ss -s
sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_available_congestion_control \
  net.ipv4.tcp_congestion_control net.core.default_qdisc \
  net.core.rmem_max net.core.wmem_max net.ipv4.tcp_rmem \
  net.ipv4.tcp_wmem net.core.somaxconn \
  net.ipv4.tcp_max_syn_backlog net.core.netdev_max_backlog \
  net.ipv4.tcp_notsent_lowat net.ipv4.ip_forward \
  net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding net.ipv4.tcp_fastopen \
  net.ipv4.tcp_ecn net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies net.ipv4.tcp_mtu_probing

tc -s qdisc show
dev=$(ip -o route get 1.1.1.1 | awk '{for(i=1;i<=NF;i++) if($i=="dev") print $(i+1)}' | head -1)
tc -s class show dev "$dev" 2>/dev/null || true
tc filter show dev "$dev" 2>/dev/null || true
ethtool -k "$dev" 2>/dev/null || true
cat /proc/net/softnet_stat 2>/dev/null | head
find /etc/sysctl.d -maxdepth 1 -type f -name '*.conf' -print -exec sed -n '1,160p' {} \;

```

## PMTU and iperf3 Tests

Run peers sequentially. Snapshot qdisc/TCP counters before and after each test window. If the peer inventory includes soon-to-expire or throwaway VPSs, test them only when they help diagnose reachability; base persistent sysctl/qdisc/MTU/shaping decisions on the durable peers that match the user's real traffic path.

PMTU ladder for IPv4:

```bash
tracepath -n <peer> || true
for s in 1472 1452 1432 1412 1392 1352 1332 1312 1292; do
  mtu=$((s+28))
  ping -M do -s "$s" -c 2 -W 1 <peer> >/dev/null 2>&1 \
    && echo "payload=$s mtu=$mtu OK" \
    || echo "payload=$s mtu=$mtu FAIL"
done
```

iperf3 pattern; adapt direction to user-critical path:

```bash
iperf3 -c <peer> -p <port> -t 12 -O 2 -P 1 -J
iperf3 -c <peer> -p <port> -t 12 -O 2 -P 4 -J
iperf3 -c <peer> -p <port> -t 12 -O 2 -P 1 -R -J
iperf3 -c <peer> -p <port> -t 12 -O 2 -P 4 -R -J
```

Record bitrate, retransmits, cwnd/RTT clues, startup behavior, single-flow vs multi-flow differences, qdisc drops/backlog deltas, and TCP retransmission counter deltas.

Safer temporary server lifecycle:

```bash
# On the peer under test. Avoid pkill -f because the pattern may match
# the current SSH shell command line and kill the session before setup.
mkdir -p /root/network-tuning-$RUN_ID/tests/$peer
PIDFILE=/root/network-tuning-$RUN_ID/tests/$peer/iperf3-server.pid
LOGFILE=/root/network-tuning-$RUN_ID/tests/$peer/iperf3-server.log
if [ -f "$PIDFILE" ]; then
  oldpid=$(cat "$PIDFILE" 2>/dev/null || true)
  if [ -n "$oldpid" ] && ps -p "$oldpid" -o comm= 2>/dev/null | grep -q '^iperf3$'; then
    kill "$oldpid" || true
  fi
  rm -f "$PIDFILE"
fi
iperf3 -s -p <port> -D --forceflush --pidfile "$PIDFILE" --logfile "$LOGFILE"
# Cleanup: kill only the verified PID from PIDFILE, then remove temporary firewall rules that this run added.
```

## Interpretation Rules

| Evidence | Likely meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Single-flow low, multi-flow high | BDP, per-flow path limits, loss recovery, or congestion-control behavior. |
| qdisc drop/backlog increases during test | Local egress queue/shaping may matter. |
| qdisc drop/backlog stays zero but retransmits high | Suspect path, upstream, or remote receiver before local buffer/shaping changes. |
| Durable peers clean but temporary peers weak | Tune for durable peers; report temporary-peer weakness separately. |
| High retransmits with low cwnd | Loss/congestion is more likely than missing buffer. |
| One peer bad, others clean | Do not downsize global capacity from one weak peer. |
| HY2/TUIC/QUIC issue | Validate MTU/qdisc/CPU and app loss; TCP buffer may be irrelevant. |

Relay hosts: identify where traffic enters and leaves; a user download may correspond to relay egress toward landing. Kernel forwarding means TCP buffer/BBR might not affect forwarded TCP the same way userspace proxy termination does.

Landing hosts: if they terminate or re-originate TCP, BBR/fq/buffers/notsent/TFO/ECN can matter more directly. Separate web/proxy TCP behavior from UDP/QUIC behavior.

## Candidate Tuning Decisions

- BBR/fq: prefer when available and appropriate; use bbr3 only if exposed by kernel.
- Buffers: estimate from bandwidth-delay product, memory, role, and concurrency. Small 100M hosts often need conservative ceilings. 1G hosts may justify 64-128MB. Higher values need evidence.
- MTU: keep 1500 when clean. Consider 1450-1460 for mild tunnel/provider overhead, or 1400-1440 for nested encapsulation/consumer ISP/UDP paths, only with evidence.
- HTB/TBF: test practical stable uplink with 95/90/85/80/75% ladder. Choose the highest cap that lowers retransmits/drops without harming critical throughput. Keep fq as the child qdisc.
- qos-agent: reserve for adaptive per-peer/per-port/per-source control; do not deploy by default.
- IPv4 preference: compare real IPv4 and IPv6 service paths first. `/etc/gai.conf` changes libc address selection; it does not rewrite DNS responses.
- Conntrack: inspect whether the host actually traverses NAT/firewall conntrack and compare `nf_conntrack_count` with the limit. Do not derive table size from RAM alone.
- RPS/RFS: use only when queue topology and per-CPU softirq evidence show a receive-side bottleneck. The per-queue `rps_flow_cnt` values should add up sensibly to `rps_sock_flow_entries`; RSS may already make RPS redundant.
- MSS clamp: use on a forwarding/tunnel path only when PMTU evidence supports it, and persist the rule through the host's nftables/iptables/UFW ownership model.
- File limits: inspect the daemon's current and systemd limits; prefer a service drop-in over an indiscriminate global million-entry limit.

## Recommendation and Safe Apply Process

1. Explain the planned change and measurements that justify it.
2. Present exact recommended config before applying: proposed `/etc/sysctl.d/*.conf` content, any qdisc/systemd/MTU/qos-agent commands, rejected candidate knobs, risk/interruption notes, verification plan, and rollback plan.
3. Stop for user approval unless the current user message explicitly says to apply the recommendation.
4. After approval, back up `/etc/sysctl.conf` and `/etc/sysctl.d/`.
5. Write one consolidated sysctl.d file for active tuning; avoid order-dependent conflicts.
6. Apply with `sysctl --system`.
7. Confirm SSH and critical services still work.
8. Read back effective sysctl/qdisc values.
9. Rerun the most important tests.
10. Roll back or revise if worse.
11. Write `/etc/sysctl.d/*.profile.md` with role, durable peers, tests, chosen values, reasoning, caveats, backup path, and rollback commands.

When writing profile Markdown from shell, use quoted heredocs for static content or avoid backticks in unquoted heredocs:

```bash
cat > /etc/sysctl.d/99-zz-tcp-tuning.profile.md <<'EOF'
# profile text with literal backticks is safe here
EOF
```

An unquoted heredoc containing Markdown code fences can trigger command substitution and accidentally run rollback-looking commands.

## Final Report Checklist

- Inspected hosts and roles.
- Durable peers used for decisions, and any temporary/non-renewing peers intentionally excluded.
- Tests run and user-critical results.
- Changes applied and explicit non-changes.
- Retransmission, qdisc, PMTU, and bottleneck interpretation.
- Backup/profile paths and rollback commands.
- Remaining uncertainty and next tests.
- Mask IPs unless the user asked for raw addresses.
